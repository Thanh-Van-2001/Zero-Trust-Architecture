I. Definition:
The Zero Trust System is an integrated security platform that uses summary information from the system's identity, security and infrastructure, as well as risk and analysis tools to inform and enable activation. countermeasures against the entire enterprise. Zero Trust transforms from a fringe model to a model that places a deeper emphasis on identity and resource security. As a result, organizations can continuously adapt to control despite changing externalities, achieving higher-level security, reducing risk, and increasing business agility. business.
Instead of assuming everything behind the corporate firewall is secure, the Zero Trust model assumes a breach and verifies each request as if it originated in the open network. No matter where that request originates or access to any resource, Zero Trust always reminds us to "never trust, always verify". Each access request is fully authenticated, authorized, and encrypted before access is granted. The principles of ultra-small partitioning and least privileged access are applied to minimize network intrusion. Rich information and analytics are used to detect and respond to anomalies in real time.

II. Nature:
    The essence of the Zero Trust method is to not trust anyone, even if it is an employee. Every time someone tries to access your network, you must verify that they are trustworthy through real-time information from multiple sources before granting them access, regardless of their location. The assumption is that threats exist inside and outside of traditional network boundaries, and that a breach is inevitable or has already occurred.
