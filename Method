Instead of assuming everything behind the corporate firewall is secure, the Zero Trust model assumes a breach and verifies each request as if it originated in the open network. No matter where that request originates or access to any resource, Zero Trust always reminds us to "never trust, always verify". Each access request is fully authenticated, authorized, and encrypted before access is granted. The principles of ultra-small partitioning and least privileged access are applied to minimize network intrusion. Rich information and analytics are used to detect and respond to anomalies in real time.
